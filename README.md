# 🫀 Heart Disease Predictor

Predict the presence of heart disease using clinical features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more. This project applies machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset to support early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes.

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a supervised classification approach to predict heart disease presence based on patient data. It uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset and includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 🧠 Models Used
 
- Gradient Boosting Classifier like Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBClassifier)

Each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and F1-score to ensure robust performance.
